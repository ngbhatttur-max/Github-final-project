Technical Steering Committee (TSC)
The TSC will be responsible for all technical oversight of the OpenEEW project. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone.

The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

Responsibilities
The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

Coordinating the technical direction of the Project.
Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope).
Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects.
Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements.
Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities.
Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies.
Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing.
The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the CONTRIBUTING file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in this CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

TSC Voting
While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

What should I know before I get started?
Atom and Packages
Atom is a large open source project — it's made up of over 200 repositories. When you initially consider contributing to Atom, you might be unsure about which of those 200 repositories implements the functionality you want to change or report a bug for. This section should help you with that.

Atom is intentionally very modular. Nearly every non-editor UI element you interact with comes from a package, even fundamental things like tabs and the status-bar. These packages are packages in the same way that packages in the Atom package repository are packages, with one difference: they are bundled into the default distribution.

atom-packages

To get a sense for the packages that are bundled with Atom, you can go to Settings > Packages within Atom and take a look at the Core Packages section.

Here's a list of the big ones:

atom/atom - Atom Core! The core editor component is responsible for basic text editing (e.g. cursors, selections, scrolling), text indentation, wrapping, and folding, text rendering, editor rendering, file system operations (e.g. saving), and installation and auto-updating. You should also use this repository for feedback related to the Atom API and for large, overarching design proposals.
tree-view - file and directory listing on the left of the UI.
fuzzy-finder - the quick file opener.
find-and-replace - all search and replace functionality.
tabs - the tabs for open editors at the top of the UI.
status-bar - the status bar at the bottom of the UI.
markdown-preview - the rendered markdown pane item.
settings-view - the settings UI pane item.
autocomplete-plus - autocompletions shown while typing. Some languages have additional packages for autocompletion functionality, such as autocomplete-html.
git-diff - Git change indicators shown in the editor's gutter.
language-javascript - all bundled languages are packages too, and each one has a separate package language-[name]. Use these for feedback on syntax highlighting issues that only appear for a specific language.
one-dark-ui - the default UI styling for anything but the text editor. UI theme packages (i.e. packages with a -ui suffix) provide only styling and it's possible that a bundled package is responsible for a UI issue. There are other bundled UI themes, such as one-light-ui.
one-dark-syntax - the default syntax highlighting styles applied for all languages. There are other bundled syntax themes, such as solarized-dark-syntax. You should use these packages for reporting issues that appear in many languages, but disappear if you change to another syntax theme.
apm - the apm command line tool (Atom Package Manager). You should use this repository for any contributions related to the apm tool and for publishing packages.
atom.io - the repository for feedback on the Atom.io website and the Atom.io package API used by apm.
There are many more, but this list should be a good starting point. For more information on how to work with Atom's official packages, see Contributing to Atom Packages.

Also, because Atom is so extensible, it's possible that a feature you've become accustomed to in Atom or an issue you're encountering isn't coming from a bundled package at all, but rather a community package you've installed. Each community package has its own repository too.

Package Conventions
There are a few conventions that have developed over time around packages:

Packages that add one or more syntax highlighting grammars are named language-[language-name]
Language packages can add other things besides just a grammar. Many offer commonly-used snippets. Try not to add too much though.
Theme packages are split into two categories: UI and Syntax themes
UI themes are named [theme-name]-ui
Syntax themes are named [theme-name]-syntax
Often themes that are designed to work together are given the same root name, for example: one-dark-ui and one-dark-syntax
UI themes style everything outside of the editor pane — all of the green areas in the packages image above
Syntax themes style just the items inside the editor pane, mostly syntax highlighting
Packages that add autocomplete providers are named autocomplete-[what-they-autocomplete] — ex: autocomplete-css
Design Decisions
When we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it in the atom/design-decisions repository. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is not documented there, please open a new topic on Github Discussions, the official Atom message board and ask your question.

How Can I Contribute?
Reporting Bugs
This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report 📝, reproduce the behavior 💻 💻, and find related reports 🔎.

Before creating bug reports, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

Note: If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

Before Submitting A Bug Report
Check the debugging guide. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of Atom, if the problem happens when you run Atom in safe mode, and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.
Check the faq and the discussions for a list of common questions and problems.
Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?
Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, record the GIF with the Keybinding Resolver shown. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
If you're reporting that Atom crashed, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in Console.app under "Diagnostic and usage information" > "User diagnostic reports". Include the crash report in the issue in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.
If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it, that normally means that you have a syntax error in one of your themes or in your styles.less. Try running in Safe Mode and using a different theme or comment out the contents of your styles.less to see if that fixes the problem.
If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.
Provide more context by answering these questions:

Can you reproduce the problem in safe mode?
Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?
If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from the releases page.
Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some? Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?
Include details about your configuration and environment:

Which version of Atom are you using? You can get the exact version by running atom -v in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the Application: About command from the Command Palette.
What's the name and version of the OS you're using?
Are you running Atom in a virtual machine? If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?
Which packages do you have installed? You can get that list by running apm list --installed.
Are you using local configuration files config.cson, keymap.cson, snippets.cson, styles.less and init.coffee to customize Atom? If so, provide the contents of those files, preferably in a code block or with a link to a gist.
Are you using Atom with multiple monitors? If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?
Which keyboard layout are you using? Are you using a US layout or some other layout?
Suggesting Enhancements
This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion 📝 and find related suggestions 🔎.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check this list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please include as many details as possible. Fill in the template, including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion
Check the debugging guide for tips — you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using the latest version of Atom and if you can get the desired behavior by changing Atom's or packages' config settings.
Check if there's already a package which provides that enhancement.
Determine which repository the enhancement should be suggested in.
Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux.
Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most Atom users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a community package.
List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.
Specify which version of Atom you're using. You can get the exact version by running atom -v in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the Application: About command from the Command Palette.
Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.
Your First Code Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the Atom Flight Manual is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in atom/flight-manual.atom.io.

Additional Notes
Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Atom repositories, but some are specific to atom/atom.

GitHub search makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in open issues across atom/atom and all Atom-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced or perhaps open pull requests in atom/atom which haven't been reviewed yet. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in atom/atom only and also across all Atom repositories. We encourage you to read about other search filters which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue has a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on atom/atom if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.

How to contribute to Ruby on Rails
Did you find a bug?
Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Rails, and instead to refer to our security policy.

Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. Simply copy the content of the appropriate template into a .rb file, make the necessary changes to demonstrate the issue, and paste the content into the issue description:

Active Record (models, encryption, database) issues
Active Record Migrations issues
Action View (views, helpers) issues
Active Job issues
Active Storage issues
Action Mailer issues
Action Mailbox issues
Action Pack (controllers, routing) issues
Generic template for other issues
For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our reporting guidelines.

Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?
Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before submitting, please read the Contributing to Ruby on Rails guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted (read more about our rationales behind this decision).

Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
Suggest your change in the rubyonrails-core forum and start writing code.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

We generally reject changes to Active Support core extensions. Those change should be proposed in the Ruby issue tracker instead, as we don't want to conflict with future versions of Ruby.

Do you have questions about the source code?
Ask any question about how to use Ruby on Rails in the rubyonrails-talk mailing list.
Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?
Please read Contributing to the Rails Documentation.
Ruby on Rails is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the team!

Thanks! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

Rails Team
